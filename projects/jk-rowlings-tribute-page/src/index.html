  <p id="tribute-info">Joanne Rowling was conceived on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital close to Bristol, and experienced childhood in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales. 

Her dad, Peter, was an airplane engineer at the Rolls Royce production line in Bristol and her mom, Anne, was a science specialist in the Chemistry office at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself went to class. 

Jo needed to be an author since the beginning. She kept in touch with her first book at six years old – an anecdote about a bunny, called 'Hare'. At only eleven, she thought of her first novel – around seven reviled jewels and the individuals who possessed them. 

Jo learned at Exeter University, where she read so broadly outside her French and Classics prospectus that she timed up a fine of £50 for past due books at the university library. Her insight into Classics would one day prove to be useful for making the spells in the Harry Potter arrangement, some of which depend on Latin. 

Jo imagined Harry Potter in 1990 while sitting on a deferred train from Manchester to London King's Cross. Throughout the following five years, she started to outline every one of the seven books of the arrangement. She composed for the most part in longhand and step by step developed a mass of notes, a large number of which were jotted on odd pieces of paper. 

Taking her notes with her, she moved to northern Portugal to show English as an unknown dialect, wedded Jorge Arantes in 1992 and had a girl, Jessica, in 1993. At the point when the marriage finished soon thereafter, she came back to the UK to live in Edinburgh, with Jessica and a bag containing the initial three parts of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
