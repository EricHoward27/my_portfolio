            Hello, my name is Eric Howard. I am a self-taught full-stack
            developer. I always dream of becoming a expert in coding, I
            originally plan to to get into programming for the video gaming
            industry. Later on, I found myself interested in mobile development,
            that is how I train myself on how to design mobile and web
            application. I am new to all of this, I plan to expand my knowledge
            even further, no matter the opportunity that I get before me. I want
            to become on of the best developer, although it is a hard peak to
            reach I believe in it which is why everyday I practice coding and
            learn new technologies everyday. The most important thing is that I
            love to do it.

          <h3>My Education</h3>
          <p>
            I graduate from the University of Purdue Global with a AAS in
            Software Development. I was primarily focus on java language
            throughout those two years. I learn most of my coding Skills from
            watching youtube videos. I recently learn about all the resources
            available for self-taught developers like myself. I enroll in
            freecodecamp & currently found myself wanting to learn more with
            udemy.

          <h3>My Skills & Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I don't have any industry level skills yet. Nor have I even look for
            one. I been wanting to learn the technologies before I am ready to
            set myself out there. But that was then. Now I feel confident in my
            abilities to work for any company. What I will provide is hard-work
            and grit. I never give up on anything, there is always a solution
            and tend to find that. The next time I visit my portfolio page, I
            hope to fill in this section with more detail about my experience as
            a full-stack developer. As for work I done, I have create projects
            to display my skillset, I have experience with designing a client's
            website using wordpress/elementor.
